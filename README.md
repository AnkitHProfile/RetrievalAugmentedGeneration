# Retrieval Augmented Generation
The code begins by importing several necessary libraries, including gdown, os, urllib, torch, time, datetime, math, numpy, faiss, textwrap, Dataset from datasets, and pandas. It also installs faiss-cpu and datasets using pip.

Next, it mounts Google Drive to the Colab environment using the drive module from the google.colab library. This step allows access to files stored in Google Drive. The code defines the path to a directory named "Files" within the Google Drive and initializes lists to store titles and articles extracted from these files. It also sets up a counter to keep track of the number of processed files.

The code iterates through each file in the specified directory. It skips files that do not have a .txt extension. For each valid file, it opens the file in read mode, decodes the filename to create a readable title (replacing underscores with spaces), and checks if the title is not empty. If the title is valid, it adds the title to the titles list and the content of the file to the articles list. It increments the counter and prints the number of processed files at intervals of 100.

After processing the files, the code creates a Dataset object using the datasets library and saves it as a file. It then loads this file back into a DataFrame using pandas. The code sets up FAISS for similarity search by building an index and adding encoded document embeddings. It saves the FAISS index and reloads it later for searching.

To handle the embeddings, the code sets up the RAG model and tokenizer using transformers from Hugging Face. It tokenizes the documents and creates a PyTorch dataset with these tokens. It then creates a PyTorch DataLoader for batch processing.

For the question-answering functionality, the code defines a function to ask a question and get a response from the model. This function tokenizes the input question, generates an answer using the RAG model, decodes the generated answer, and prints both the question and the answer along with the response time.

Finally, the code tests the question-answering function with specific questions. It provides sample questions like "How many models have been created by Cerebras?" and "What is Hierarchical RAG?" to illustrate the functionality of the RAG model in generating responses based on the input questions. The entire setup demonstrates how to integrate document retrieval and question answering using advanced machine learning models in a practical workflow.
